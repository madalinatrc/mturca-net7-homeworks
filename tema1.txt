I'm making coffee.
I go to the kitchen.
I open the coffee machine, if there is no water left, I put water in the tank.
I turn on the coffee machine, if there are no coffee beans left, I open the cupboard and take the coffee.
I pour the coffee into the machine.
if everything is ready, I take a cup from the cupboard.
then I put coffee and turn on the coffee machine.
Done.



I drive the car.
I go to the basement.
unlock the car.
I start the engine.
I check if I have windshield fluid, if I don't, I go to the trunk, open the trunk, take the fluid, close the trunk.
I open the hood and lid. when I pour the liquid, I make sure that I don't spill it.
if everything is fine, then I can leave by car.
Done.
